found gap(a,b) offby one error in gen_transitions.pl

main problem here was that all probes after the lazy router
had their probes incremented, including ones that took
a different, shorter path.  PROBLEM: some of the probes that
took a different shorter path came before the discovery of the
lazy routers, and created wrong gaps.
