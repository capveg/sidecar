THis trace is a huge mess.  There is a RR multipathing split that happens at hop 1, and one path is TTL longer
then the other.  This requries the more paranoid tookSamePath() checking in the perl where we have
to test aRR[i]=bRR[i] for i=0 to min (#aRR,#bRR) as opposed to checking is the last entry the same.

The ipcolo,mp2 amsterdam alias at the end is wrong, but we have insufficient info to figure that out here.
