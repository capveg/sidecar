gap at hop 6 caused two RR hops to become aliases within the
gap (8.81 and 8.13) and the off by one of 8.81 and 8.80
didn't get connected.

kscyng to dnvr doesn't seem to get discovered. (the alias of
8.81) because of lack of response.

doesn't recover -- 8.77 and 8.76 aren't off-by oned (because
abilene, I suppose)
