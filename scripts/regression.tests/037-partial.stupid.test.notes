doesn't look like we get hung up with the stupid router (do we?)
but we do get screwed by layer2 flapping

this trace is just a mess :-(

some false aliases that need to be fixed but I don't know how:

capveg@scriptroute:~> sr-ally 63.211.169.157 4.68.100.4
NOT ALIAS. quick (2): 63283, 13026

but most things just don't repond :-(
