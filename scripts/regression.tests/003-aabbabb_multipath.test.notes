level3 multipath at hop seven might confuse.

tr source is-not-an-alias-for rr(trace, 2, ip), likely a needed rule.

should be able to infer hop 6 is type B (AABBABB), 

hop 8 is likely type B (off by one 222 /221) - works in the
implementation when testing.

doesn't merge all the car3.LosAngeles1's (4.68.102.14,
4.68.102.78, 4.68.102.174, 4.68.110.221, 4.68.102.110)
though I'm not disappointed.

mistakenly (atm) merges 209.247.8.24[12] with
4.68.105.{135,129}, which themselves shouldn't be merged.
hop 6 says 4.68.105.219 can't be an alias for 4.68.105.135,
which is rr(trace, *2*, ...).  and 242 can't be an alias for
135, again, in the same rr line.

Autogen transitions fixed some problems; still contains stupid routers at bbr{1,2} in Level3
