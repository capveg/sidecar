Andrew Goldberg's max-flow code:
types.h
timer.c
hi_pr.c
parser.c
makefile

Modified unDNS:
originForIP
originForIP.c
Modified to construct the data structure, then continuously read IP addrs from
stdin, outputting their AS.

preprocess.rb : takes a file in capveg format and translates it to
a format with just edges.  Output can then be run by run_max_flow.rb.
Expects the modified "originForIP" to be in the local directory.

run_max_flow.rb : see above.  Runs Goldberg's max flow on all "AS*" pairs
in the input file, and outputs the max flow = number of disjoint paths between
each AS.  Expects "hi_pr" to be an executable in the local directory.

loop_analyze.rb : process output traces to see which contain loops

loop_get_stats.rb : output various stats about loops, the routers in loops, their AS, etc.
