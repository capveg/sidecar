TCP Sidecar 		- Rob Sherwood, Neil Spring '06
	http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/sidecar
-------------------------------------------------------------

Look at "INSTALL" for installation instructions
"README.experiments" for instructions for replicating our experiments
"condor/README" for instructions for replicating DisCarte's analysis

Relevant parts:
	- libsidecar.{a,so} in the main directory
		- sidecar.h documents the API
	- ./passenger/	: Tool described in IMC06 "Touring the Internet in a TCP Sidecar"
		- Does not initiate it's own connections, but takes a libcap filter string
			and listens for connections matching those
	- ./sideping/	: Ping replacement that functions like netcat but uses sidecar-style
		TCP probes to get RTT times
	- ./sidetrace/	: Traceroute replacement that adds RR functionality; works like netcat
			(one shot version of passenger)
	- ./artrat/ : Tool from WORLDS06 "A Platform for Unobtrusive Measurement"
		artrat == Active Receiver-side TCP Rate Analysis Tool
		Uses correlates RTT data with router delay on incoming links with IP Timestamp
		option to help locate local bottlenecks.
	- ./scripts/ : A multitude of (potentially) useful scripts for data analysis and 
		replicating results.  Interesting points:
		- ./makemap.sh is a script that takes any number of
			traces output by passenger, runs them through data2adjacency.pl
			to create an adjacency list, then uses Graph Viz (www.graphviz.org)
			to create viewable pdf file of the map generated
