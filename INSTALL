TCP Sidecar INSTALL instructions:

You need a recent copy of libpcap to run sidecar.  Some of the scripts in the ./scripts/
directory require Graphviz from www.graphviz.org.


1) There is currently no configure script: run `make` (requires GNU make)
	The code should be fairly portable, please mail me (capveg@cs.umd.edu) if
	you find it otherwise and are willing to contribute a patch to fix it.
2) `make install` puts the relevant binaries and  libraries into ./tar/
	and `make tar` creates a tgz file for ease of moving compiled binaries
	to different machines.  If you want to install sidecar into a system wide
	place, run `make install` and copy the files out of ./tar and put them
	in place by hand (this will be improved, time available).
