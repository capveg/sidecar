- do sidecar and tcp stuff in one thread

1) spawn n grabber threads
2) run sc_do_loop()
3) For each grabber thread:
	sleep(1)	// let sidecar init
	while(sites exist)
		grab new site
		connect
		send request
		parse response
		(repeat until enough data has been sent)
		wait for signal
		on signal, shutdown connection
4) on connect, 
	schedule idle
5) if idle, and enough data has been sent,
	send packet train of length $safelen
	on done, signal thread
6) on icmp in, record data
7) on in packet, signal got response from endhost
	on done, signal thread
8) on outpacket, record timestamp if probe
9) on close,
	signal thread
